								<p>Hello there! Thank you for hitting my personal websites. My name is Jihar Gifari. Some people call me Jihar, Jey, or Gifari. 
									Currently I am working as a Data Tech Officer at PeopleShift. I am responsible to teach ShiftAcademy’s students and improve 
									the services of ShiftAcademy’s Products. I have several professional working experiences in Data Science fields such as 
									performing as Trainer Assisstant at Xeratic, an IT Consulting Company in Indonesia. I was also a Data Science Content Writer 
									at DQLab, an online learning platform for Data Science. Previously, I took a Data Science and Machine Learning Program at 
									Purwadhika Digital Technology School, one of the prestigious digital technology schools in Indonesia. Accumulatively, 
									I have more than 1 year experiences in Data Science Fields.</p>

								<p> Back in High School, I wasn’t a Tech Savvy person. I can’t even change the screensaver of my own computer back there. 
									But, fortunately I changed my mindset during my college. I started to think that there is no lack of talent, there is
									only lack of skill, and skill can always be improved. If I am not a great person in terms of IT related stuff, it’s 
									not because I wasn’t made for this nor because I am just not that good at this field. I believe that, if anyone puts 
									in a lot of effort to learn a particular field, they will always be able to master the field. So I tried to learn 
									graphic design during my first year at college. When I see what I can actually do, I realize that I am able to basically 
									learn anything. Hence, learning has become my favorite word ever since. I learn about capital market and research during 
									my penultimate year, I learn about being a master of ceremony during my college, I even learn about programming, data 
									science and machine learning right after college. I graduated with a 3.6 GPA within 3.5 year with a lot of new experience 
									and skill.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/malay_1.jpeg" alt=""  /></div>
								<p> For the past few years, I have had some organizational experiences, like performing as General Secretary of Forum Studi 
									Islam dan Lingkungan (FORSTILLING), a Muslim student community in Brawijaya University. Apart from that role, I was also 
									the initiator of PISEI (Program Intensif Skripsi Ekonomi Islam), which allowed me to help penultimate year student to learn 
									about research and finish their minor thesis. In spite of that, I have had various and numerous experiences in the public 
									speaking area. Ever since my adolescence, I have been used to joining any debate and speech competition. Besides, I also 
									have experience in being a Moderator and Master of Ceremony in various national events with dozens of public figures like 
									Sandiaga Uno, Bena Kribo, Fellexandro Ruby, Iyas Lawrance, etc. From those experiences, I have developed my leadership skills, 
									team and time management, public speaking and other soft skills that I could not get from my academic study
